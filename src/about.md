I most recently worked as a software engineer at Facebook for 4 years. Before
that, at Microsoft for a few years. I've worked on a variety of consumer
products.

A few notable projects I've done outside of work:
- [How to Center in CSS][css]: a CSS generator for every situation.
- [JƒÅas - JavaScript as a Service][jaas]: write code the way you want and this
  will convert it to modern, socially acceptable JavaScript.
- [Songs You Liked on Pandora][pandora]: because Pandora won't give you a list
  for everything.
- [FUN+][fun]: manually add runs to your Nike+ account when the app crashes.
