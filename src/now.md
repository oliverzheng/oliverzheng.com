I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Stripe][stripe], trying to make
certain APIs work better.

Outside of work, I'm trying to spend as much time with my infant son as
possible. It's quite life changing.

Soon after his birth, I realized I need to be in better shape to keep up with
his increasing weight and activity. I built a home gym and now pray at the iron
church.

Besides me, this website also deserves to be in better shape. I'm working
towards having this be a place on the Internet for myself.
